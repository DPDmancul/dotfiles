# i3 (window manager)

i3 is configured with home-manager but must be activated also at system level to set the environment (eg. opengl, dconf, …)

```nix modules/system/i3.nix
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  services.xserver = {
    enable = true;

    desktopManager = {
      xterm.enable = false;
    };

    windowManager.i3 = {
      enable = true;
      package = pkgs.unstable.i3; # TODO stable after gaps being merged
      extraPackages = [ ];
    };
  };
}
```
